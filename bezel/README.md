# Bezel

Bezel is the physics engine that powers the inside of Atlas. It now supports two backends, each one defining its own features and its own capabilities.

The two backends that Bezel supports right now are:

- Bezel Native 1 (since Alpha 1)
- Bezel Jolt 1 (since Alpha 6)

We would like to express our sincere gratitude to the team behind Jolt Physics at [their repo](https://github.com/jrouwe/JoltPhysics).

_Bezel Jolt arrives to Jolt version 5.5.0 released on December 28th, 2025_
_Bezel Native supports limited features and is in highly development status, therefore, Bezel Jolt is the default for games made with Atlas_
