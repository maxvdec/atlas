# The Opal Renderer

Opal is the backbone rendering system for Atlas. It is designed to be fast, flexible, and extensible, allowing developers to create rich graphical applications with ease.
Opal supports OpenGL up to version 4.1 and it is going to provide a Vulkan backend as fast as we can implement it.

The backend is designed to be modular, allowing for easy integration of new rendering techniques and optimizations.
Opal also includes a robust shader management system, making it simple to create and manage complex shader programs.
