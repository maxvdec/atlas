# Opal 1.1 Ellipse

Opal is the backbone rendering system for Atlas. It is designed to be fast, flexible, and extensible, allowing developers to create rich graphical applications with ease.
Opal supports OpenGL up to version 4.1 and a Vulkan backend.

The backend is designed to be modular, allowing for easy integration of new rendering techniques and optimizations.
Opal also includes a robust shader management system, making it simple to create and manage complex shader programs.

It provides a high-level API for common rendering tasks, such as scene management, lighting, and post-processing effects.

And also for Vulkan it provides reflection for uniform buffers and push constants using SPIRV-Cross.
